      <h1>My Favorite Songs of 2023</h1>
      <p>

      <p>Since I first read it, something that’s stuck with me is Mark Richardson’s description of how listening to music on headphones can give a sensation where <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/listening-for-silence-with-the-headphones-off/" target="_blank">“the visual field is colored by the tone of the music, and the music is given a different emotional tint by the visuals”.</a> As someone who’s spent a lot of time walking around with headphones and unnecessarily romanticizing the world around me, this resonated with me. Similar to that experience, I find that all of my favorite music takes shape to fit my life, rarely just being songs I like but more like a soundtrack for my memories.</p>
      <p>Super Shy stands on its own as a fun (arguably the <em>most</em> fun) kpop song, but for me, it’s also linked to a summer filled with so much friendship and love. I can already see myself feeling nostalgic about this song years from now, particularly so when I visit New York. I’d like to remember how Lean Beef Patty blew me away so much that I was inspired to get back into making music, which ended up being a really freeing and meaningful creative pursuit for me. Baby again.. revived a lost love for dance music that led my friends and I to go to see Skrillex, even if it might have been about 10 years late. The ending of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> was one of the most powerful emotional experiences I’ve ever had with a game and the music of that game was a huge part of that. Almost every song on this list has its own small story in my year and when I was putting this together, I felt myself thinking the most about that.</p>
      <p>
        Music always plays an important role in my life but that role can differ so much. Last year, I often turned to music for meaning when I was feeling lost, and that’s certainly still present in this list. This year though, I felt like music was most present as a soundtrack to a bunch of fond memories. I feel so grateful for that as I reflect on the past year.

        I also want to make a note that I am very excited to show my grandchildren Skeeyee, one of the greatest rap songs of our time.
