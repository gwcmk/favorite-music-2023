      <h1>My Favorite Songs of 2023</h1>

        Regardless of what’s happening, I think it’s beautiful how music can take shape to fit however you’re feeling. Super Shy stands on its own as a fun (arguably the most fun) kpop song, but for me, it’s also linked to a summer filled with so much friendship and love. I can already see myself feeling nostalgic about this song years from now, particularly so when I visit New York. I’d like to remember how Lean Beef Patty blew me away so much that I was inspired to get back into making music, which ended up being a really freeing and meaningful creative pursuit for me. Baby again.. revived a lost love for dance music that led Rahul and me to go to our first EDM festival. The ending of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was the most powerful emotional experience I’ve had with a game in years. Almost every song on this list has its own small story in my life and when I was putting this together, I felt myself thinking the most about that.

        Music always plays an important role in my life but that role can really differ. Last year, I often turned to music for meaning when I was feeling lost, and that’s certainly still present in this list. This year though, I felt like music was most present as a soundtrack to a bunch of fond memories. I feel so grateful for that as I reflect on the past year.

        I also want to make a note that I am very excited to show my grandchildren Skeeyee, one of the greatest rap songs of our time.
